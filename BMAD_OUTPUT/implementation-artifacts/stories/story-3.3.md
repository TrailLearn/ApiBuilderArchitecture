# Story 3.3: Approve & Publish Workflow

As an Administrator,
I want to officially publish a validated scholarship,
So that it becomes visible to the public.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** I have reviewed a scholarship and verified its details
**When** I click the 'Approve & Publish' button
**Then** the scholarship status is updated to 'PUBLISHED'
**And** it immediately becomes visible to the public API
**And** an audit log event is recorded for this action
