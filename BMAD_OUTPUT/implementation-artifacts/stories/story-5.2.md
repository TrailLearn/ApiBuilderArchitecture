# Story 5.2: My Submissions View

As a Contributor,
I want to see the status of scholarships I submitted,
So that I know if they have been approved or rejected.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** I am on the 'My Submissions' page
**When** the page loads
**Then** I see a list of scholarships where `submitter_id` matches my ID
**And** I can see their current status (Pending, Published, Rejected)
