# Story 7.2: Admin Audit View (UI)

As an Administrator,
I want to see the history of a scholarship,
So that I can understand the decisions made by other admins.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** I am on the admin detail view of a scholarship
**When** I scroll to the 'History' or 'Audit' section
**Then** I see a chronological list of all status changes
**And** each entry shows the date, the actor name (or ID), and the status transition
