# Story 4.3: Search & Filters

As a Visitor,
I want to filter scholarships by criteria,
So that I can find ones relevant to me.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the scholarship list view
**When** I enter a search term or select a filter (e.g., Amount > 1000)
**Then** the list updates to show only matching records
**And** the filtering happens efficiently using Supabase query parameters
